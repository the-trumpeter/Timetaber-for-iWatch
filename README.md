## <i>Is it a typo? Is it a spelling error? NO! It's an Apple Watch Timetable App!</i>
Developed by me, Gill Palmer, the-trumpeter, this app is made to solve one of my biggest educational issues:
<b>forgetting my timetable.</b>  
So far; I've successfully created a basic app that is installed on my Apple Watch for everyday use. My personal timetable is hardcoded into it.
<br>

### Public release?
<b>Maybe.</b>\
Hopefully I will be able to create a version that I can release to friends and throughout my school.\
Keep an eye on the 'Controlled Release' milestone!




### Note on errors in repository
Since I'm not actively collaborating with anybody I often commit all my changes after each session.
I have been trying to keep it a bit cleaner lately through the use of branches; I hope it helps.
Sorry if the repository's code is erroring, you can probably guess that I don't know how to fix it.

## `stable` branch

This branch contains the latest stable, working version of Timetaber, regardless of tags and releases.
If something's in here, it definetly works; and if it doesn't, then do something about it!!
